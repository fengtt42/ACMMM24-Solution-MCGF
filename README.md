# Multi-weather Cross-view Geo-localization Using Denoising Diffusion Models

This is the code repository of UAVM Workshop solutions of ACM MM24.

## Multi-weather Cross-view Geo-localization
Cross-view geo-localization depends on finding the correct location by matching drone-view images with satellite-view images. Weather variants, including fog, rain, snow, and multiple weather compositions, are randomly sampled to increase the difficulty of geo-localization. The red box represents the correct match we want to achieve regardless of weather conditions.

## Models
MCGF establishes a joint optimization between image restoration and geo-localization using denoising diffusion models. For image restoration, MCGF incorporates a shared encoder and a lightweight restoration module to help the backbone eliminate weather-specific information. For geo-localization, MCGF uses EVA-02 as a backbone for feature extraction, with cross-entropy loss for training and cosine distance for testing.

## Experiment_1
> We visualize heatmaps and Top-5 matching results generated by our method in 10 different weather conditions. Since the drone is flying around, the drone images are not only interfered with by the weather but also by rotational posture. Therefore, we also show the impact of drone posture changes on geo-localization.
